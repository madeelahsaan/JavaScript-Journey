//Practice Question : prompt the user to enter their full name. Then generate the username name for them based of input. Start username with @, follow by their fullname and ending with the fullname length.

// using Template literal
/*
let fullName = prompt("Enter your full Name without space");
fullName = fullName.toLowerCase();
let length = fullName.length;
console.log(`@${fullName}${length}`);
*/


// using concat
/*
let fullName = prompt("Enter your full Name without spaces.");
fullName = fullName.toLowerCase();
let userName = "@" + fullName + fullName.length;
console.log(userName);
*/


// Write a program to concatenate two strings entered by the user.
// Example: "Hello" + "World" â†’ "HelloWorld"
/*
let prac1Var1 = "hell0";
let prac1Var2 = "World";
prac1Var1 = prac1Var1.concat(prac1Var2);
console.log(prac1Var1);
